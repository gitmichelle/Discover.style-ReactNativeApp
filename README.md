# Discover.style
By **Michelle Llaguno & Sightworks**


## Summary
For my Epicodus internship I worked with Sightworks, a SaaS company in Portland, OR, and built a magazine-style fashion and beauty React Native app from the ground up. This was the first time either of us worked in React. The content and images are imported via a custom API that was written by their Lead Developer, who also helped with some of the back-end functionality. My role was to build the app according to Eric Dayton's (owner/designer) wireframes and mock-ups, which came out very close to his exact specifications. The code cannot be shown as this was an internal and propriatary project for Sightworks.
